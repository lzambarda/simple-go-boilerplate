# Simple Go boilerplate

The goal of this repo is to provide some microservices-oriented ideas and give tips to any Go developer.

Go is a fantastic language with simplicity at its core and its community is great.
However I think that there's so much freedom on how to set up a project that newcomers may get overwhelmed.

I know that many other repositories like this exist, this is just my take at trying to provide a very simple layout with clear explanation. Feel free to provide suggestions to improve this!

In my opinion the best approach remains to start with a single `main.go` file and slowly evolve and structure the project as it goes.

Enjoy!
